  | Ron Wayne was a co-founder of Apple and helped draft the company’s original partnership agreement. However, he left the company shortly after its founding in 1976, thus playing a minimal role in its long-term development. Despite his early departure, his foundational contribution to Apple’s inception remains historically significant.

动态社区选择算法`dynamic_community_selection`。该算法利用索引数据集的知识图谱结构。从知识图谱的根开始，我们使用`提示工程 + 大模型`来评估社区报告在回答用户问题方面的相关性。如果报告被视为不相关，则将其及其节点（或子社区）从搜索过程中删除。另一方面，如果报告被视为相关，将遍历其子节点并重复该操作。最后，只有相关的报告才会传递给 `map-reduce` 操作以生成对用户的响应。如下图所示："]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9c3ca5cc-631a-4c9a-b01e-32d38d53d5da","metadata":{"id":"9c3ca5cc-631a-4c9a-b01e-32d38d53d5da"},"source":["<div align=center><img
